The goal of the hackathon was to create an application or device that aided relief to natural disasters. Our application is a website that utilizes Google Maps API to overlay layers of information onto a map. This included info such as heatmaps of population and areas of high risk, locations of disaster relief shelters, and last-known locations of missing persons.
